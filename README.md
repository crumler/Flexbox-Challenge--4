# Conquering Responsive Layouts (Flexbox Challenge #4)

This is one of the challenges provided within a "Conquering Responsive Layout" 21-day course that I have been taking in my spare time.

I wanted to display this particular challenge within my GitHub profile because I feel that it fully demonstrates how I structure my code within HTML / CSS.

It also demonstrates my skills in coding a web page when given a web design document to base off of.
